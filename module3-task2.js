/*
Using everything youâ€™ve learned up until this point, write a script that asks a user about the width, height, and length of
a box, then calculate and return to the user the volume of this box.
As an example, a box with width = 20, height = 10, and length = 50 will have a volume of 10000 (omitting units, as they
are not relevant in this scenario). For now, assume that the values provided by the user are valid numbers, but if
you have any ideas on how, you can try to make this script in such a way that it will be resistant to invalid values
*/

let width = window.prompt("Enter the box width", 0);
let height = window.prompt("Enter the box height", 0);
let length = window.prompt("Enter the box length", 0);

let volume = width * height * length;
alert(`Your box's volume is: ${volume}`);
